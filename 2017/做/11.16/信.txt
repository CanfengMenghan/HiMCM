Dear Mayor,
Our team has carefully planned the light show on the night of the annual festival and succeeded in creating three possible sky displays including the pattern of a ferris wheel, a dragon and a map of China. The whole performance will include 477 drones, and all the people in this city can enjoy this well-organized fantastic light show.

All the drones that will be used in this show should be ready about 20 minutes before the show starts and the place for the light show needs to be spacious (especially avoid the city center in order to make sure the traffic won't be blocked), and after the careful examination, the square in the north of the city is a suitable place. Our team also suggest that the show should begin at 7:30pm since it would be completely dark at that time and the audience can fully enjoy this visual feast. Therefore, the drones should be in place at about 7:10, and before that, we want to make sure that all the roads around the place should be cleared so that the potential accident can be avoided. The apron will cover approximately the space of 100m*70m on the ground and the whole performance will occupy the total space of 200m*70m*200m. The total time of the light show will be no longer than 20 minutes according to the weather condition and the limited time a drone can constantly fly in the sky.
